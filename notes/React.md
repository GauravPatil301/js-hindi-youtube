# React Interview Questions

**1. What is React and how does it work?**

   React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes, using a virtual DOM to minimize direct manipulation of the actual DOM for better performance.

**2. What is JSX?**

   JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React. It allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. JSX gets transpiled to regular JavaScript using tools like Babel.

**3. Explain the concept of Virtual DOM in React.**

   The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM. When there are changes in the data, React calculates the difference (diffing) between the current Virtual DOM and the new one, and then applies the minimal updates to the real DOM.

**4. What are React components?**
   React components are reusable building blocks that define how a UI element should appear and behave. They can be either class components or functional components.

**5. What is the difference between a functional component and a class component?**

   Functional components are simpler and easier to write. They are pure JavaScript functions that take props as input and return JSX. Class components have additional features like state and lifecycle methods.

**6. Explain the concept of props in React.**
   Props (short for properties) are inputs that a parent component can pass to its child components. They are immutable and help components communicate by sharing data.

**7. What is state in React?**

   State is a mechanism for a component to keep track of its own data. It's mutable and can be changed using the `setState` method. When state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the updated data.

**8. What is the significance of the `key` prop in lists?**

   The `key` prop is used to help React identify which items have changed, added, or removed from a list of elements. It helps in optimizing the rendering process by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

**9. What are React hooks?**

   React hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components. Examples include `useState` for managing state and `useEffect` for handling side effects.

**10. Explain the `useState` hook.**

   The `useState` hook is used to add state to functional components. It returns a current state value and a function to update that state. It's often used in a destructuring assignment, like `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`.

**11. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook?**
   The `useEffect` hook is used for performing side effects in functional components. It runs after every render and can be used to manage things like data fetching, subscriptions, and DOM manipulations.

**12. What is Redux, and how does it relate to React?**
   Redux is a state management library that works well with React. It helps manage the state of an application in a centralized store and provides predictable state changes using actions and reducers.



**1. Can you explain the React component lifecycle methods?**

   Sure. React class components have several lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. These methods allow you to control what happens when a component is mounted, updated, or unmounted. With the advent of React Hooks, you can achieve similar functionality using the `useEffect` hook.

**2. How does React Router work, and how would you handle dynamic routing?**

   React Router is a library that enables navigation between different parts of your application. Dynamic routing involves passing parameters in the URL. For instance, you can use the `useParams` hook to access dynamic values from the URL.

**3. What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?**

   Higher-Order Components are a pattern used in React to enhance the functionality of components. They take a component as input and return a new component with added features. With the introduction of hooks, HOCs are less common, as hooks like `useContext` and `useMemo` can achieve similar results.

**4. Explain the concept of Render Props in React.**

   Render Props is a pattern where a component's prop is a function that returns JSX. This pattern allows you to share code between components by encapsulating common logic in the function.

**5. How would you optimize the performance of a React application?**

   Performance optimization in React involves techniques like:
   - Using the `shouldComponentUpdate` method or `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   - Implementing lazy loading and code splitting to load only necessary parts of the app.
   - Using a state management library like Redux for better control over state updates.
   - Memoizing expensive computations using `useMemo` and `useCallback`.

**6. What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React forms?**

   Controlled components are those where the form data is controlled by React state, while uncontrolled components store their own form data in the DOM. Controlled components offer better control and validation over form data.

**7. How does React handle server-side rendering (SSR)?**

   SSR is a technique where initial rendering of the app occurs on the server, and then the client-side JavaScript takes over. React supports SSR through libraries like Next.js. SSR improves SEO and initial page load times.

**8. Explain the concept of Context in React and when would you use it?**

   Context provides a way to share data between components without having to pass props through every level of the component tree. It's used when data needs to be accessible to many components at different nesting levels, like themes, user data, etc.

**9. How do you handle state management without using Redux?**

   You can manage state using React's built-in `useState` and `useReducer` hooks. For more complex scenarios, you might use context API. Redux is recommended for larger applications where centralized state management is crucial.

**10. What is the significance of the `key` prop in lists, and how would you optimize rendering in large lists?**

   The `key` prop helps React identify individual items in a list, aiding in efficient updates. For large lists, you can use techniques like virtualization (e.g., `react-virtualized`) to render only visible items, improving performance.
